    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Momma's Healthy Meatloaf: Mix lean ground turkey, oats, veggies, and spices. Form into a loaf, top with a glaze of tomato sauce, honey, and Dijon. Bake at 375°F for a nutritious delight.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 green bell paper, diced</li>
        <li>½ cup diced sweet onion</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 pound extra-lean (95%) ground beef</li>
        <li>1 cup whole wheat bread crumbs</li>
        <li>¾ cup shredded carrot</li>
        <li>¾ cup shredded zucchini</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>¼ cup ketchup, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Coat a 9x5-inch loaf pan with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir bell pepper and onion in hot oil until onion is translucent and bell pepper is softened, 5 to 10 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove the skillet from heat.</li>
        <li>Combine ground beef, bread crumbs, carrot, zucchini, eggs, salt, pepper, and bell pepper mixture in a large bowl; mix well using your hands. Press mixture into the prepared loaf pan.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, 35 to 40 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Spread ketchup over meatloaf and continue baking until bubbling, about 5 minutes more.</li>
    </ol>
